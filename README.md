# COVID-19-SIR-Simulation
This simulation was made following the work of this YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAmZe5D3v5I.

This program simulates the spread of COVID-19 using an SIR model. The goal is to help with the visualization of an SIR model.
The parameters used in this model are (probably) now inaccurate.
